#Healthifyme-FollowupTask

1.	All the images are being referenced from Assets.
2. Image mapping is through the **config.json** file - 'imagePath', 'legendImagePath' are the property names.

#Testing

1. Added a UnitTesting target - **FollowUpTaskTests**.
2. My integral object is **ObjectMap** - without this app won't work at all.
3. Test cases cover *ObjectMap, ProductCategory, Offer, Product*.
